# Z Camera
This project includes the SDK document for Z camera(http://www.z-cam.com).<br>
We provide some way to control the camera:
  * HTTP API to build a new App for iOS/Android, PC as well.
  * VISCA protocol with some extention. (You need a cable for expandtion port)
  * Linux userspace development. (TBD)
